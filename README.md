Welcome!
Thank you for checking out my San Diego Top Spots project. This is a simple webpage to show users some of the cool places to go while in San Diego, California. The user can read a short description about one of the 'Top Spots' and then click a button to take them to a map of the location on Google maps.

How to open:
Using the command prompt, enter 'code ~/oca/startnow-web101-san-diego-top-spots' and push enter to open the project in visual studio code. To start the application, run static.
